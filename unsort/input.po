msgid "RFC 1918 defines three ranges of IPv4 addresses not meant to be routed on the Internet but only used in local networks. The first one, <literal>10.0.0.0/8</literal> (see sidebar <xref linkend=\"sidebar.networking-basics\" />), is a class-A range (with 2<superscript>24</superscript> IP addresses). The second one, <literal>172.16.0.0/12</literal>, gathers 16 class-B ranges (<literal>172.16.0.0/16</literal> to <literal>172.31.0.0/16</literal>), each containing 2<superscript>16</superscript> IP addresses. Finally, <literal>192.168.0.0/16</literal> is a class-B range (grouping 256 class-C ranges, <literal>192.168.0.0/24</literal> to <literal>192.168.255.0/24</literal>, with 256 IP addresses each). <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html\" />"

msgid "The gateway can also perform two kinds of <emphasis>network address translation</emphasis> (or NAT for short). The first kind, <emphasis>Destination NAT</emphasis> (DNAT) is a technique to alter the destination IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) for a (generally) incoming connection. The connection tracking mechanism also alters the following packets in the same connection to ensure continuity in the communication. The second kind of NAT is <emphasis>Source NAT</emphasis> (SNAT), of which <emphasis>masquerading</emphasis> is a particular case; SNAT alters the source IP address (and/or the TCP or UDP port) of a (generally) outgoing connection. As for DNAT, all the packets in the connection are appropriately handled by the connection tracking mechanism. Note that NAT is only relevant for IPv4 and its limited address space; in IPv6, the wide availability of addresses greatly reduces the usefulness of NAT by allowing all “internal” addresses to be directly routable on the Internet (this does not imply that internal machines are accessible, since intermediary firewalls can filter traffic)."
